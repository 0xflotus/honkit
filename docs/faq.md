#### Does GitHon supports RTL/bi-directional text ?

The GitHon format supports right to left, and bi-directional writing. To enable it, you either need to specify a language (ex: `ar`), or force GitHon to use RTL in your `book.json`:

``` json
{
    "language": "ar",
    "direction": "rtl"
}
```

With version 3.0 of GitHon, it's automatically detected according to the content.
_Note that, while the output book will indeed respect RTL, the Editor doesn't support RTL writing yet_.

You should always use paths and the `.md` extensions when linking to your files, GitHon will automatically replace these paths by the appropriate link when the pointing file is referenced in the Table of Contents.

Yes, GitHons can be created in [sub-directories](structure.md#subdirectory). legacy.githon.com and the CLI also looks by default in a serie of [folders](structure.md).

#### Does GitHon supports RTL languages?
